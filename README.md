gogctune
gogctune is a dynamic, adaptive Go package that automatically tunes the GOGC value in real-time. It monitors your application's garbage collector (GC) and memory metrics to intelligently balance memory usage and CPU overhead, helping you optimize performance without manual tuning.

Features
Automatic GOGC Tuning: Eliminates the guesswork of setting the right GOGC value.

Adaptive Policies: Choose a tuning strategy that fits your application's needs.

Lightweight: Runs as a single, lightweight goroutine.

Easy Integration: Start tuning with just a few lines of code.

Installation
go get [github.com/devglyph1/gogctune](https://github.com/devglyph1/gogctune)

Quick Start
To start the tuner with the default Balanced policy, add the following to your main function.

package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	
	"[github.com/your-username/gogctune/gogctune](https://github.com/your-username/gogctune/gogctune)" // Adjust this import path
)

func main() {
	// Create a context to manage the tuner's lifecycle.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	// Start the tuner with the default Balanced policy.
	stopTuner, err := gogctune.Start(ctx, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to start gogctune: %v", err)
	}
	// Defer the stop function to ensure it's called on exit.
	defer stopTuner()

	log.Println("gogctune is running. Application starting...")

	// --- Your application logic goes here ---
	// For example, start your web server, job processor, etc.
	// select {} // Block forever
}

Tuning Policies
You can choose from three pre-built policies depending on your performance goals:

NewBalancedPolicy() (Default): Aims to keep GC CPU usage within a stable, low-overhead range (3-5%). It will prioritize CPU stability first, then optimize for memory efficiency when CPU is not under pressure.

NewFavorCPUPolicy(): Aggressively works to reduce GC CPU overhead. It will increase GOGC significantly if GC is consuming too much CPU, even if it means using more memory. Ideal for CPU-bound or latency-sensitive applications.

NewFavorMemoryPolicy(): Aggressively works to reduce memory consumption. It will lower GOGC if the heap grows too quickly, even if it means spending more CPU time on garbage collection. Ideal for memory-constrained environments.

Using a Specific Policy
To use a policy other than the default, simply create it and pass it to the Start function.

// Example for a memory-constrained environment
policy := gogctune.NewFavorMemoryPolicy(nil) // Pass nil to use the default logger
stopTuner, err := gogctune.Start(ctx, policy)
// ...
